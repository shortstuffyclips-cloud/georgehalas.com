      <h1>Power, stability, and the survival of the league</h1>
      <p>
        George Halas’s influence extended far beyond the sidelines.
        For decades, he functioned as one of the NFL’s central power brokers,
        helping guide the league through instability, war, expansion,
        and the early television era.

        <h2>A stabilizing force in a fragile league</h2>
        <p>
          In the NFL’s early years, franchises frequently folded,
          relocated, or struggled financially.
          Halas emerged as one of the league’s most consistent owners,
          advocating for stability and long-term planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          His willingness to endure short-term losses in exchange
          for league credibility helped the NFL survive its most
          precarious decades.

        <h2>Shaping rules and competitive balance</h2>
        <p>
          Halas supported rule changes designed to improve fairness,
          safety, and spectator appeal.
          He recognized that the league’s survival depended on
          competitive balance rather than domination by a few teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          His advocacy for shared standards influenced how the NFL
          approached scheduling, officiating, and roster rules.

        <h2>The draft and parity</h2>
        <p>
          As the league expanded, Halas supported the NFL Draft
          as a mechanism to distribute talent evenly.
          While not always benefiting the Bears directly,
          the draft helped preserve league-wide competitiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This emphasis on parity became one of the NFL’s defining
          strengths in the television era.

      <div class="card-pad">
        <h2>Owners, commissioners, and power struggles</h2>
        <p>
          Halas worked alongside multiple commissioners,
          including Bert Bell and Pete Rozelle.
          While he did not always agree with league leadership,
          he understood the importance of centralized authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          His disputes — including stadium and scheduling conflicts —
          reflected broader tensions between tradition and modernization.

        <h2>Television and the modern NFL</h2>
        <p>
          The rise of television transformed professional football.
          Halas supported national broadcasting agreements,
          recognizing that shared revenue would strengthen the league.
        </p>
        <p>
          This decision helped propel the NFL into America’s most
          dominant sports league.

        <p>
          Halas’s leadership helped transform the NFL from a
          collection of independent teams into a unified,
          national institution.
