      <h1>George “Papa Bear” Halas</h1>
      <p>
        George Stanley Halas (1895–1983) was one of the central architects of professional football.
        He helped organize the league that became the NFL, built the Chicago Bears from a small-town
        company team into a flagship franchise, and influenced the sport as a coach, owner, and
        league leader for more than six decades.

        <h2>Chicago roots and an engineer’s mindset</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Chicago in 1895, Halas grew up in a city shaped by industry, immigration,
          and hard work. He attended the University of Illinois, where he became a standout
          multi-sport athlete while earning a degree in civil engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          That engineering background would later define his approach to football.
          Halas believed teams were systems to be built through preparation, repetition,
          and structure—an idea that set him apart in the NFL’s early years.

        <h2>World War I and Great Lakes football</h2>
        <p>
          During World War I, Halas served as an officer in the U.S. Navy and played for the
          Great Lakes Naval Training Station football team. Service teams were filled with
          elite college talent and drew national attention at a time when professional
          football was still struggling for credibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 1919 Rose Bowl, featuring Great Lakes, placed Halas on a national stage and
          reinforced his belief that football could succeed beyond the college level
          if properly organized and promoted.

        <h2>Present at the NFL’s birth</h2>
        <p>
          In 1920, Halas represented the Decatur Staleys at a meeting in Canton, Ohio,
          where professional teams organized what would become the National Football League.
          From that moment forward, Halas’s career became inseparable from the league’s history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professional football at the time was unstable—teams folded, schedules shifted,
          and rules were inconsistent. Halas emerged as a stabilizing figure who pushed for
          structure and credibility.

        <h2>The Chicago move and the Bears identity</h2>
        <p>
          In 1921, Halas moved the Staleys to Chicago, a decision driven by survival rather
          than prestige. Chicago offered crowds, newspapers, and a major-league sports culture.
          After one season, the team became the Chicago Bears, aligning football with the city’s
          baseball identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The move proved transformative, helping professional football gain legitimacy
          and laying the foundation for one of the NFL’s most enduring franchises.

        <h2>Innovation, war, and longevity</h2>
        <p>
          Halas coached the Bears through multiple eras, pioneering strategic innovations
          and adapting as the game evolved. His teams dominated the 1940 NFL Championship
          Game with the T-formation offense, reshaping professional football.
        </p>
        <p>
          After returning from service in World War II, Halas continued to lead and adapt,
          culminating in a final championship as head coach in 1963.

          George Halas’s influence extends beyond wins and losses.
          He helped transform professional football into a stable,
          national institution—one that still reflects the principles
          he championed.
