        <h2>Chicago upbringing</h2>
        <p>
          George Stanley Halas was born in Chicago in 1895 to Czech immigrant parents.
          Growing up in a working-class environment instilled values of persistence,
          responsibility, and self-reliance that would later define his leadership style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chicago’s rapidly growing sports culture exposed Halas to competition
          at multiple levels, fostering an early appreciation for organized athletics.

          Halas attended the University of Illinois, where he excelled as a
          multi-sport athlete while earning a degree in civil engineering.
          He played football, baseball, and basketball, demonstrating versatility
          and discipline.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Professional baseball and athletic range</h2>

          Before fully committing to football, Halas briefly played professional
          baseball, including time with the New York Yankees organization.
          The experience exposed him to professional sports operations
          beyond football.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observing baseball’s structure and promotion influenced how he later
          envisioned professional football’s growth.

        <p>
          Halas served as an officer in the United States Navy during World War I.
          Stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, he played for one
          of the most competitive service football teams in the country.
        </p>

          By the time Halas entered professional football administration,
          he possessed a rare combination of athletic skill, technical education,
          and leadership experience.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          Halas’s early experiences explain why he approached football
          not just as a game, but as a system that could be built,
          refined, and sustained.
