      <h1>Why George Halas still defines professional football</h1>
      <p>
        George Halas’s influence did not end when he stepped away from the sideline.
        His ideas, decisions, and leadership helped shape the NFL’s structure,
        competitive balance, and identity. Few figures in American sports history
        have left a deeper or more lasting imprint.

        <h2>Longevity unmatched in professional sports</h2>
        <p>
          Halas’s association with the NFL spanned more than six decades.
          He was present at the league’s founding, coached through multiple
          strategic eras, and remained an influential owner well into
          the modern age of professional football.
        </p>
        <p>
          That continuity provided the league with institutional memory
          during periods of rapid change, including expansion,
          television growth, and evolving labor relations.
        </p>

        <h2>Records and milestones</h2>
        <p>
          For many years, Halas held the NFL record for most career wins
          by a head coach, a testament to his adaptability across eras.
          His teams won championships before and after World War II,
          and again during the league’s television boom.
        </p>
        <p>
          These accomplishments reinforced the idea that sustained success
          required more than talent — it required leadership,
          organization, and long-term vision.
        </p>

        <h2>Institutional recognition</h2>
        <p>
          Halas was a charter inductee of the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
          a reflection of his foundational role in the league.
          The NFC championship trophy bears his name,
          ensuring that his legacy remains visible every postseason.
        </p>
        <p>
          These honors reflect more than nostalgia;
          they acknowledge Halas’s role in creating a sustainable,
          nationally dominant sports league.

        <h2>The Bears identity</h2>
        <p>
          The Chicago Bears remain one of the NFL’s most recognizable franchises,
          defined by defense, discipline, and tradition.
          These traits trace directly back to Halas’s philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as the league has modernized, the Bears’ identity continues
          to reflect the principles Halas embedded decades earlier.

        <h2>Why Halas still matters</h2>
        <p>
          Modern NFL fans may focus on quarterbacks, contracts,
          and media deals, but the league’s structure was built
          by early architects like Halas.
        </p>
        <p>
          His emphasis on stability, parity, and professionalism
          remains central to the NFL’s continued dominance.

        <p>
          George Halas did not simply succeed within the NFL.
          He helped design the league itself — a legacy
          few figures in sports history can claim.
