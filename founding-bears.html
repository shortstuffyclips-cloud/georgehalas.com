        <h1>Decatur Staleys → Chicago Bears</h1>
        <p>
          Halas moved to Decatur to work for the A. E. Staley Company and became player-coach of the company-sponsored football team.
          In 1920 he represented the club at the meeting that formed the American Professional Football Association, which became the NFL in 1922.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1921, Augustus E. Staley agreed to turn over control of the team so Halas could move it to Chicago. The club played as the
          <b>Chicago Staleys</b> in 1921, then took the name <b>Chicago Bears</b> in 1922—chosen as a nod to the Cubs and the larger size of football players.

      <h2>Key moments</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><b>1920:</b> Organized meeting-era pro football; represented the Staleys at the league’s founding meeting.</li>
        <li><b>1921:</b> Team moved to Chicago; played at Cubs Park (later Wrigley Field).</li>
        <li><b>1922:</b> Renamed the team the Chicago Bears.</li>

      <h2>Why the move mattered</h2>
      <p>
        Chicago offered a bigger fan base, stronger gate receipts, and a clearer identity. The Bears quickly became one of the league’s anchor franchises—
        and Halas became one of pro football’s most visible builders.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        “If baseball players are Cubs, then football players must be Bears!” — a later recollection attributed to Halas about the 1922 name change.
