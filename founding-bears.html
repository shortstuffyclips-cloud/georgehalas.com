      <h1>From Decatur to Chicago: building a franchise that could survive</h1>
      <p>
        The Chicago Bears did not begin as a powerhouse franchise.
        They began as a company-sponsored team in central Illinois,
        operating in a professional football world that lacked stability,
        structure, and long-term vision. George Halas’s decisions during
        these formative years would determine not only the Bears’ future,
        but the future of the NFL itself.

        <h2>The Decatur Staleys and early pro football</h2>
        <p>
          In the late 1910s, professional football teams were often sponsored
          by factories or local businesses. The Decatur Staleys were backed by
          the A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company and operated with modest resources,
          limited attendance, and uncertain schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halas joined the Staleys as a player and organizer, quickly becoming
          the team’s driving force. Even at this early stage, he recognized that
          small-town football had hard limits. Without larger crowds and media
          attention, the sport would never gain legitimacy.

        <h2>1920: organizing a league instead of chaos</h2>
        <p>
          In 1920, representatives from professional teams gathered in Canton,
          Ohio, to establish order in the sport. Halas attended as the Staleys’
          representative. That meeting led to the formation of the American
          Professional Football Association, later renamed the NFL.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, teams frequently folded midseason, rules varied by region,
          and championships were disputed. Halas supported the idea that professional
          football needed centralized governance and shared standards to survive.

        <h2>The Chicago move: survival through scale</h2>
        <p>
          In 1921, Halas moved the Staleys from Decatur to Chicago. The decision
          was driven by survival, not prestige. Chicago offered a major sports
          market, newspaper coverage, and established venues like Cubs Park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial backing from A. E. Staley helped fund the move, with the
          condition that the team retain the “Staleys” name for one season.
          After that, Halas rebranded the team as the Chicago Bears.

        <h2>Branding the Bears</h2>
        <p>
          The name “Bears” aligned the football club with the Chicago Cubs,
          reinforcing the idea that professional football belonged alongside
          baseball as a major-league sport. This early branding decision helped
          fans identify with the team and its city.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was one of the first examples of intentional sports branding in
          professional football — a reminder that Halas understood marketing
          as well as competition.

        <h2>The Red Grange effect</h2>
        <p>
          In 1925, the Bears signed Red Grange, the most famous football player
          in America. Attendance surged immediately, and the Bears became the
          center of professional football’s first national spotlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          A grueling barnstorming tour followed, exposing professional football
          to audiences across the country. While exhausting, the tour proved
          that pro football could draw crowds and generate revenue nationwide.

        <h2>From experiment to institution</h2>
        <p>
          By the late 1920s, the Bears were no longer a fragile experiment.
          They had a home, a brand, and a central role in a league that was
          slowly stabilizing. Halas’s insistence on professionalism helped
          turn chaos into continuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bears’ rise mirrored the NFL’s rise — from uncertainty to
          legitimacy — and the Chicago move remains one of the most important
          decisions in league history.

        <div class="kicker">Why it mattered</div>
        <p>
          The move from Decatur to Chicago was more than a relocation.
          It was one of the first moments when professional football
          acted like a long-term business rather than a local novelty.
