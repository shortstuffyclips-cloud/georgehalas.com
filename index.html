      <h1>George “Papa Bear” Halas</h1>
      <p>
        George Halas was not simply present at the birth of professional football —
        he helped design it. As a founder of the National Football League,
        the driving force behind the Chicago Bears, and one of the sport’s most
        enduring leaders, Halas shaped American football for more than sixty years.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site explores the full scope of his influence — from early league
        survival and championship dominance to rule innovations, business decisions,
        and the legacy that still defines the NFL today.
