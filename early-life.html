          Halas attended the University of Illinois and later served in the U.S. Navy. After the war years,
          he briefly played Major League Baseball with the New York Yankees before stepping into the emerging world of professional football.

      <h2>Setting the stage</h2>
      <p>
        In the early 1900s, pro football was still unstable—teams folded often, travel was difficult, and few players could make a living from the sport.
        The leaders who kept organizations alive had to do everything: recruit, coach, schedule, sell tickets, and sometimes even handle equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Halas emerged in that world as a rare “full-stack” sports leader—comfortable in athletics, organization, and promotion.
        Those strengths would matter when he joined the A. E. Staley Company in Decatur, Illinois.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="quote">
        Later sources describe him as a multi-sport athlete and organizer who quickly became responsible for athletics around the Staley company team.
