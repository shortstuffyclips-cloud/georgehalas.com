      <h1>How George Halas helped shape modern football</h1>
      <p>
        George Halas was not just a successful coach — he was present at several
        turning points where professional football was forced to evolve.
        His legacy includes rule innovations, strategic breakthroughs,
        and an early understanding that football could be studied,
        engineered, and improved.

        <h2>Football as a system</h2>
        <p>
          Halas approached football with an engineer’s mindset.
          Practices were structured, assignments were clearly defined,
          and repetition was treated as a competitive advantage.
          This philosophy stood in contrast to the improvisational
          style common in early professional football.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the league matured, this systematic approach became essential.
          Teams that could execute assignments consistently gained
          a decisive edge.

        <h2>1932: the indoor playoff that changed the rules</h2>
        <p>
          In 1932, severe winter weather forced a playoff game to be
          moved indoors to Chicago Stadium.
          The smaller field required temporary rule changes,
          including placing the ball between hash marks
          and moving goal posts to the goal line.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bears won the game 9–0, but the long-term impact
          mattered more than the score.
          The NFL adopted several of the improvised rules permanently,
          helping distinguish professional football from the college game.

        <h2>The quarterback evolution</h2>
        <p>
          Early football relied heavily on running attacks
          and single-wing formations.
          The quarterback was not yet the central decision-maker
          seen in modern football.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halas recognized that offensive balance required a true
          field general.
          The development of the T-formation placed the quarterback
          at the center of the offense, demanding precision,
          timing, and leadership.

      <div class="card-pad">
        <h2>The T-formation breakthrough</h2>
        <p>
          The Bears’ use of the T-formation reached its peak
          in the 1940 NFL Championship Game,
          when Chicago defeated Washington 73–0.
          The lopsided victory demonstrated the formation’s
          devastating potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the game, teams across the league adopted
          similar offensive systems.
          The result was a league-wide transformation that
          shaped offensive football for decades.

        <h2>Adaptation across eras</h2>
        <p>
          Halas’s greatest coaching strength may have been
          his ability to adapt.
          He coached before and after World War II,
          through rule changes, roster turnover,
          and strategic shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          His willingness to evolve allowed the Bears
          to remain competitive across generations,
          reinforcing his reputation as one of the NFL’s
          most influential coaches.

        <p>
          Many of the NFL’s modern characteristics —
          structured offenses, quarterback-centered systems,
          and standardized rules — trace back to
          the innovation-driven era Halas helped create.
