      <h1>Defining victories of the Halas era</h1>
      <p>
        George Halas’s Bears teams won championships across multiple eras of professional football.
        These victories were not only about titles — they marked moments when the sport itself
        changed. From rule innovations to strategic dominance, Halas-era championships helped
        define what the NFL would become.

        <h2>1932: the indoor playoff</h2>
        <p>
          The 1932 NFL season ended in a tie between the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans.
          Brutal winter weather forced the playoff game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium,
          creating a unique and unprecedented setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bears won 9–0, but the significance extended far beyond the score.
          Temporary rule changes — including hash marks and goal-post placement —
          were later adopted by the league, shaping professional football’s future.

        <h2>1940: 73–0 and the T-formation explosion</h2>
        <p>
          On December 8, 1940, the Bears delivered the most lopsided championship victory
          in NFL history, defeating Washington 73–0.
          The game showcased the devastating potential of the T-formation offense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result stunned the football world. Afterward, teams across the league
          restructured their offenses, accelerating the transition to quarterback-centered play.
          The 1940 championship remains a turning point in NFL strategy.

        <h2>1963: defense, cold, and a final statement</h2>
        <p>
          Halas’s final championship came in 1963, when the Bears defeated the New York Giants
          14–10 at Wrigley Field. The game was played in extreme cold and fading daylight,
          conditions that favored preparation and discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bears’ defense forced multiple turnovers and controlled the pace of the game.
          The victory served as a capstone to Halas’s career, proving his methods remained effective
          in a modernizing league.

        <h2>Championships as legacy markers</h2>
        <p>
          Each Bears championship under Halas marked a distinct era.
          Together, they tell the story of professional football’s evolution —
          from experimental beginnings to tactical sophistication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Halas’s ability to win across generations remains one of the most remarkable
          achievements in NFL history.
